This project generates an incomplete Jv.Games.Xna.Portable.XForms implementation.
This can be used to build portable libraries,
but should not be used with the final executable.

Specific platform code is necessary
to implement Xamarin.Forms.Core interoperability

Available platform implementations:
  - Jv.Games.MonoGame.XForms
